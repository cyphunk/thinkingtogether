Code for the Thinking Together / The Wisdom of Crowds (working title) theatre show.

The show involves an audience contributing and voting on phrases and signals shown
on stage and utilized by two more more actors. I've used the Reactjs framework in
hopes this would make prototyping more fluid. In retrospect I'm not sure it was the
best choice. It's nice that it automatically handles addition and removal of elements
but as with all frameworks, the abstractions often create problems. And abstraction
from React is rather deep, making resolving some issues more time intensive than if
one were to work from scratch. 

Warning, definitely dirty code. Probably will not have time to clean up until after
the premier.
